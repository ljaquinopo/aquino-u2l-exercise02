## Steps on how to create a GitHub page:

### A. Creating a repository for your site
1. In the upper-right corner of any page, select **+**, then click **New repository**.
2. Use the Owner dropdown menu to select the account you want to own the repository.
3. Type a name for your repository and an optional description. If you're creating a user or organization site, your repository must be named `<user>.github.io` or `<organization>.github.io`. If your user or organization name contains uppercase letters, you must lowercase the letters.
4. Choose a repository visibility. 
5. Select **Initialize this repository with a README**.
6. Click **Create repository**.

### B. Creating your site
1. On GitHub, navigate to your site's repository.
2. Decide which publishing source you want to use.
3. Create the entry file for your site. GitHub Pages will look for an `index.html`, `index.md`, or `README.md` file as the entry file for your site.

    - If your publishing source is a branch and folder, the entry file must be at the top level of the source folder on the source branch. For example, if your publishing source is the `/docs` folder on the `main` branch, your entry file must be located in the `/docs` folder on a branch called `main`.
    - If your publishing source is a GitHub Actions workflow, the artifact that you deploy must include the entry file at the top level of the artifact. Instead of adding the entry file to your repository, you may choose to have your GitHub Actions workflow generate your entry file when the workflow runs.

4. Configure your publishing source.
5. Under your repository name, click **Settings**. If you cannot see the "Settings" tab, select the dropdown menu, then click **Settings**.
6. In the "Code and automation" section of the sidebar, click **Pages**.
7. To see your published site, under "GitHub Pages", click **Visit site**.
8. Your GitHub Pages site is built and deployed with a GitHub Actions workflow.
